# CodeWars Challenges

A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). Attempting to complete one challenge daily, and always sneaking in an extra one when possible.

# How it's made:

Everyday, I solve one CodeWar challenge.

# Optimizations
I often review my older code and optimize it as I further my knowledge.

# Lessons Learned:
The biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
